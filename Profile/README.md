Our focus is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, 
both to promote research on adding value to data, 
research deriving biological knowledge from data, 
and infrastructure making data findable and available.

At SciLifeLab, we see data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations and strive to make our data FAIR, 
handled according to open science standards and that its long-term value to the scientific community is maximized.
