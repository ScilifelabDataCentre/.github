The focus of the SciLifeLab Data Centre is on data arising from the use of SciLifeLab infrastructure platforms, 
both to promote research on adding value to data, 
research deriving biological knowledge from data, 
and infrastructure making data findable and available.

SciLifeLab sees data as one of the most valuable and long-lasting products of our operations. We strive to make our data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), 
to handle it according to open science standards and to maximize its long-term value to the scientific community.
